1. ### CSS 
* treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look
  allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

2. ###  Rules are made up of selectors 
* that specify the elements the rule applies to and declarations that indicate what these elements should look like 


 3. ###  Different types of selectors 
 * allow you to target your rules at different elements

4. ###  Declarations are made up of two parts: 
* the properties of the element that you want to change
* and the values of those properties

5. ####  CSS rules 
* usually appear in a separate document although they may appear within an HTML page
