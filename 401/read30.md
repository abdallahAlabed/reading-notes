# Hash Tables
## Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects

## Structure
### Hashing
### Creating a Hash
### Collisions

### * Hash Maps can have any number of buckets. If a hash map has only a few buckets it will be densely full and have many collisions. If a hash map has more buckets it will be more sparsely populated, there will be less collisions, but there may be a lot of extra empty space.

## Internal Methods
### Find
### Contains
### GetHash
