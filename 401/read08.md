# OO Design 

## SOLID

### * S - Single-responsiblity Principle

#### - programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part.

### * O - Open-closed Principle

#### -  the open–closed principle states "software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code. The name open–closed principle has been used in two ways

### * L - Liskov Substitution Principle

#### - The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. That requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass

### * I - Interface Segregation Principle

#### - In the field of software engineering, the interface-segregation principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them

### * D - Dependency Inversion Principle

#### - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions
