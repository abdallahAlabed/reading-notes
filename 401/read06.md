# Inheritance and Interfaces

## What Is an Object?

### an object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier

## What Is a Class?

### In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior

## What Is Inheritance?

### inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes

## What Is an Interface?

### An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behavior that classes must implement. They are similar to protocols. Interfaces are declared using the interface keyword, and may only contain method signature and constant declarations

## What Is a Package?

### A Java package organizes Java classes into namespaces, providing a unique namespace for each type it contains. Classes in the same package can access each other's package-private and protected members

## Answers to Questions and Exercises: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

## Answers to Questions

### Real-world objects contain state and behavior.
### A software object's state is stored in fields.
### A software object's behavior is exposed through methods.
### Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly exposed methods is known as data encapsulation.
### A blueprint for a software object is called a class.
### Common behavior can be defined in a superclass and inherited into a subclass using the extends keyword.
### A collection of methods with no implementation is called an interface.
### A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a package.
### The term API stands for Application Programming Interface.

## Answers to Exercises

### Your answers will vary depending on the real-world objects that you are modeling.
### Your answers will vary here as well, but the error message will specifically list the required methods that have not been implemented.
