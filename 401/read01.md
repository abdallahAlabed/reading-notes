# Java Basics:

### Variables:

  ### Kinds of variables:(1)

  * Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields): There values are unique to each instance (object) of a class, and they are declared without static keyword.

  #### * Class Variables (Static Fields): Variable declared with static keyword and apply to all instances (objects).

  #### * Local Variables: Variables declared inside a method, they have no keywords, and they can't be accessed from outside the method.

  #### * Parameters: Variables declared between the parentheses of the method.

  
 #### Expressions, Statements, and Blocks:

  * An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, example: (1) 
    
    int number = 0;
   
   #### Statement :

    expression:    
       System.out.println("Hello World!");

      declaration statements:
      double Value = 5.2;
      

    control flow :

     
       while(condition){
         // code
       }

    Block :

       if (condition) {
            System.out.println("true");
        }

    Control Flow :

  * Control Flow  enable your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.(1)

  * decision-making :if-then, if-then-else, switch
  * looping : for, while, do-while
  * branching : break, continue, return

# What does it mean to compile code:

* The computer language is (machine language) which is a series of 1's and 0's.

* Because it hard for humans to read machine language (0 & 1) they made a higher level languages like java and c#.

* The compiler takes the human code and covert it to machine language.

* If the code compiles that doesn't mean it's right ot it will work.

# Reading Java Documentation:

 Java has a standard Application Programming Interface â€”a huge library consisting of over 4,000 classes.(2)
