# Graphs
## An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
## Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.
## A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
## A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge
## A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
## An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles. 
## A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
## A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
## An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isnâ€™t a connection.
##  An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected. 
## A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights When representing a weighted graph in a matrix, you set the element in the 2D array to represent the actual weight between the two paths. If there is not a connection between the two vertices, you can put a 0, although it is known for some people to put the infinity sign instead. Within adjacency lists, you must include both the weight and the name of the adjacent vertex.
##  The traversals itself are like those of trees
