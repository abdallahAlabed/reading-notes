### The Amplify Auth category provides an interface for authenticating a user. Behind the scenes, it provides the necessary authorization to the other Amplify categories. It comes with default, built-in support for Amazon Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool. The Amplify CLI helps you to create and configure the auth category with an authentication provider.
