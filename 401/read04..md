# OOP
### Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself.

##  Object :-

### Definition: An object is a software bundle of variables and related methods. You can represent real-world objects using software objects. ... Everything that the software object knows (state) and can do (behavior) is expressed by the variables and methods within that object.

##  Class:-

### In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior

##  Inheritance:-

### In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes

## Interface:-


### In general, an interface is a device or a system that unrelated entities use to interact. ... Unlike a class, an interface never implements methods; instead, classes that implement the interface implement the methods defined by the interface

## Package:-

### A Java package organizes Java classes into namespaces, providing a unique namespace for each type it contains. Classes in the same package can access each other's package-private and protected members
