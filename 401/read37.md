# S3

## Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier.

- ### Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, and inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.

- ### This introduction to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides a detailed summary of this web service. After reading this section, you should have a good idea of what it offers and how it can fit in with your business.

- ### This guide describes how you send requests to create buckets, store and retrieve your objects, and manage permissions on your resources. The guide also describes access control and the authentication process. Access control defines who can access objects and buckets within Amazon S3, and the type of access (for example, READ and WRITE). The authentication process verifies the identity of a user who is trying to access Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Advantages of using Amazon S3

- ### Creating buckets – Create and name a bucket that stores data. Buckets are the fundamental containers in Amazon S3 for data storage.

- ### Storing data – Store an infinite amount of data in a bucket. Upload as many objects as you like into an Amazon S3 bucket. Each object can contain up to 5 TB of data. Each object is stored and retrieved using a unique developer-assigned key.

- ### Permissions – Grant or deny access to others who want to upload or download data into your Amazon S3 bucket. Grant upload and download permissions to three types of users. Authentication mechanisms can help keep data secure from unauthorized access.

- ### Standard interfaces – Use standards-based REST and SOAP interfaces designed to work with any internet-development toolkit.
