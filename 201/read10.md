# Debugging

## What debugging means?

###  Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash "when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. ... Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging."

### The debugger statement stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.`debugger;`
Using the debugger statement has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the code.
Normally, you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.


### If you understand execution contexts (which have two
stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error
in your code.

### Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a
process of deduction.

### The console helps narrow down the area in which the
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates
its own error object, which can tell you its line number
and gives a description of the error.

### If you know that you may get an error, you can handle
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
Use them to give your users helpful feedback. 

## Flash ////Is no longer supported by many browsers
Flash allows you to add animations, video and audio to
the web.
### Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad

### HTML5 introduces new `<video>` and `<audio>`
elements for adding video and audio to web pages, but
these are only supported in the latest browsers.

### Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not
all support the same video and audio formats, so you
need to supply your files in different formats to ensure
that everyone can see/hear them
